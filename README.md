# Pathfinder
## A* Algorithm Pathfinder with pygame and tkinter GUI

When you run the program you first get prompted to type the coordinates of the starting and end-point.

Then you get a big gui with a grid of blocks, on which you can draw obstacles and paths.

When you are done, the program runs its magic, using the A* algorithm, and tries to find the fastest path from the start to the end point, avoiding and pathing around obstacles.

This project is still WIP.
